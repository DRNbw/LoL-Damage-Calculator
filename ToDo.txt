*COMMENT!

*Change dps calculation from simple average to calc each hit and then average?

*BugFixes:
  +MasterYi's E and R sinergy
  +Optimal build ALWAYS fills all the possible slots: working as intended or not? (easily noticed if limited budget)
  +DPS/gold is not working very well

*Add more champions abilities:
  +Cait's passive
  +Corki's E
  +Draven's passive and Q
  +Ez's passive
  +Kog's W
  +MF's W passive
  +Trynd's Q
  +Twitch's passive and ult
  +Varus's passive and W
  +Vayne's W
  
*"Optimal build path"   
  +"Top to bottom" method: start with build, see which item increases the dps the most, take its pieces, see which increases the dps the most, etc
  +Add functional scrollbar to path
  
*Add "What's the best stat now?" (half-thought idea)  
  +Start with a build  
  +Add 1% AD/AS/ArP/etc  
  +Calculate the new DPS and compare the % change  
  +Compare the diferent increases   
  +graph versus armor?
